# Pinned dependency versions.
#
# Every library listed here is BSD/MIT/Apache-style licensed and therefore safe
# to link into an LGPL-2.1-or-later FFmpeg build. Do NOT add a library without
# checking its license first - see README.md for the policy.
#
# This file is deliberately separate from common.sh: the CI dependency cache is
# keyed on its hash alone, so fixing a build script does not throw away a
# perfectly good set of compiled dependencies. The flip side is that changing
# *how* a dependency is built does not invalidate the cache - run the workflow
# with `rebuild_deps` enabled in that case.
